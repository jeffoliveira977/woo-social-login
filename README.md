### Social Login and Advanced Security Authentication Plugin for WordPress
A robust WordPress plugin for user authentication that combines the convenience of social login with enhanced security features, including reCAPTCHA and two-factor authentication (OTP). This plugin allows you to provide a secure and seamless login experience for your users, offering the choice between social logins (Facebook and Google) or traditional account registration.

## Features
Enhance Security
Protect your WordPress site against brute force attacks, bots, and other threats with the integration of reCAPTCHA and OTP authentication. reCAPTCHA acts as a barrier against automated access, while OTP ensures that only the authorized user can access their account.

### Simplify Registration
Let users sign up quickly using their social media accounts, reducing friction and improving user experience on your site.

### Build User Trust
Show your commitment to data security by implementing extra safeguards, creating a trusted environment for your users.
