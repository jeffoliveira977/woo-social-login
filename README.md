### Social Login and Advanced Security Authentication Plugin

A robust solution for user authentication that combines the convenience of social login with enhanced security features, including reCAPTCHA and two-factor authentication (OTP). This plugin allows you to provide a secure and seamless login experience for your users, offering the choice between social logins (Facebook and Google) or traditional account registration.

Enhance Security
Protect your site against brute force attacks, bots, and other threats with the integration of reCAPTCHA and OTP authentication. reCAPTCHA serves as a barrier against automated access, while OTP ensures that only the authorized user can access their account.
